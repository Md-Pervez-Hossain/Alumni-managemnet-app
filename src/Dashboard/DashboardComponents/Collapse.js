              It really matters and then like it really doesn’t matter. What matters is
              the people who are sparked by it. And the people who are like offended by
              it, it doesn’t matter. Because it's about motivating the doers. Because I’m
              here to follow my dreams and inspire other people to follow their dreams,
              too.

              The time is now for it to be okay to be great. People in this world shun
              people for being great. For being a bright color. For standing out. But the
              time is now to be okay to be the greatest you. Would you believe in what you
              believe in, if you were the only one who believed it? If everything I did
              failed - which it doesn't, it actually succeeds - just the fact that I'm
              willing to fail is an inspiration. People are so scared to lose that they
              don't even try. Like, one thing people can't say is that I'm not trying, and
              I'm not trying my hardest, and I'm not trying to do the best way I know how.

              I always felt like I could do anything. That’s the main thing people are

              by their perception of themselves. If you're taught you can’t do anything,
              you won’t do anything. I was taught I could do everything.
